## Project Description:

This repository hosts a neural network-based solution for optimizing seating arrangements. The neural network is trained to select seating orders that take into account differences among individuals, aiming to minimize discrepancies when seating them together. Whether it's for classrooms, events, or any scenario requiring efficient and fair seating allocation, this project offers an automated solution leveraging machine learning techniques.

## Key Features:

* Neural network-based solution for seating arrangement optimization.
* Training model to minimize differences among individuals in seating arrangements.
* Automated allocation of seats for various scenarios.
